After numerous attempts on this model, as well as the three prior, this particular repository has been depreciated and archived, and further progress will be written in a new private repository.
This has been kept for my porfolio, will not be updated, and may not be used without permission from Kaynen Pellegrino, and solely from Kaynen Pellegrino.
The reason for this repo's archiving and the ending of it's work is the branching of too many tasks instead of focusing on a single job, which resulted in overlapping of module work, and ultimately me losing track of what
was doing what. I will use this as a learning tool, and will proceed to improve the model based on the work done here.
