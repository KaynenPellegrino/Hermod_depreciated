## Modular Architecture

**Decision:** Adopt a modular architecture to separate concerns.

**Reasoning:**

- **Scalability:** Modules can be developed and scaled independently.
- **Maintainability:** Easier to manage and update specific components without affecting others.
- **Collaboration:** Teams can work on different modules simultaneously.

## Technology Choices

### Programming Language: Python

- **Reasoning:** Python offers extensive libraries for AI and machine learning, and has a strong community support.

### Web Framework: Django

- **Reasoning:**

  - **Built-in Features:** Django provides an ORM, admin interface, and robust security features out of the box.
  - **Scalability:** Suitable for building scalable web applications.

## Client Portal Implementation

**Decision:** Implement a dedicated client portal within the application.

**Reasoning:**

- **User Experience:** Provides clients with a centralized place to access projects and submit feedback.
- **Security:** Allows for tailored access control and data segregation.

## Security Considerations

**Decision:** Incorporate security measures from the ground up.

**Reasoning:**

- **Data Protection:** Safeguards client data and intellectual property.
- **Compliance:** Helps in meeting regulatory requirements.
- **Trust:** Builds client confidence in the platform.

**Implementations:**

- Use of SSL/TLS for data transmission.
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for user permissions.
- Encryption of sensitive data at rest.

## Scalability and Maintainability

**Decision:** Design the system to be scalable and maintainable.

**Reasoning:**

- **Future Growth:** Accommodates increasing user base and feature expansion.
- **Ease of Updates:** Facilitates smoother updates and integration of new technologies.

**Implementations:**

- Use of containerization (Docker) for consistent deployment environments.
- Modular codebase to allow easy addition of new modules.
